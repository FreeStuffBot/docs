# Welcome

Welcome to the FreeStuff Developer Documentation.

FreeStuff's API will provide you with high quality and real time data of free games, free software, discounts, game passes, and more. You can get everything you're used to from our official Bots in a machine readable format and then some extra info on top that we don't use in our official bots.

For more information on FreeStuff check out our website at https://freestuffbot.xyz/


## Who is this API for?

The API is for everyone who would like to build their own bots, websites, publishers or whatever else using data about free games.

If you just want to get informed about free games and have no intention to build your own product, you're probably better suited using one of our official bots and don't need to use the API. More info on our website linked above.


## Pricing

In order to prevent abuse we're charging a small amount of money for access to our data. This is a monthy subscription you can cancel anytime with no questions asked.

Currently there is no free tier available. However many of our paid plans do have a free trail period available.

More info on pricing and where to purchase is coming soon.


## Contact
