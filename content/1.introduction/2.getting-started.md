# Getting Started

## API Key

All requests to the API require authorization through an API key. To get your key visit https://dashboard.freestuffbot.xyz/ and click on **Your Application**. Create an application if not done already, then scroll down until you find your API key.


## Libraries

There's libraries to interact with the API available for the following languages / ecosystems. Using such an API wrapper is the easiest way to interact with FreeStuff's API and we highly recommend using an existing API wrapper if one is available that fits your setup. Please refer to the libary's documentation for usage.
