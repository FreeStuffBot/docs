# Webhooks

FreeStuff's webhooks are `POST` requests. Each request is refered to as a 'Message' below. The messages are delivered to the url you have configured on your dashboard. All data is in the shape of the compatibility date defined on the dashboard.


## Message Payload

The message payload (http body) follows the [Standard Webhooks Spec](https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/blob/main/spec/standard-webhooks.md#payload) and looks as follows:

```jsonc
{
  "type": "urn:fsb:event:product.publish",
  "timestamp": "2022-11-03T20:26:10.344522Z",
  "data": {
    // ...
  }
}
```

See [Event List](#event-list) for a list of events.


## Message Headers

The webhook request will have the following headers:

- `X-Compatibility-Date` - the compatibility date of the content send in the payload's data field
- `Webhook-Id` - the message id, see [verifying the request](#verifying-the-request)
- `Webhook-Timestamp` - the message send timestamp, see [verifying the request](#verifying-the-request)
- `Webhook-Signature` - the message signature, see [verifying the request](#verifying-the-request)


## Verifying the request

FreeStuff signs every webhook request as per [Standard Webhooks Spec](https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/blob/main/spec/standard-webhooks.md#verifying-signatures). While not required, it is highly recommended you check for a valid signature before processing any events received.

- You can find your Ed25519 public key on your app page
- The content to be verified is `msg_id.timestamp.payload` with msg_id and timestamp being provided as `Webhook-Id` and `Webhook-Timestamp` headers respectively
- Make sure to take the raw http body (prior to parsing the JSON content) for the verification `payload`
- Make sure to store the `msg_id` for a certain amount of time to prevent package duplication and replay attacks
- Make sure to ignore requests with an old `Webhook-Timestamp` value
- Make sure to use the payload body `timestamp` field as the contextual timestamp and use the header only for verification


## Resends

FreeStuff attempts to resend failed deliveries as per [Standard Webhooks Spec](https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/blob/main/spec/standard-webhooks.md#delivery-success-and-failure). You are required to respond with a `2xx` status code after successfully **receiving** the data.

- Failure to process the data or perform actions with the data on your end should not yield a non-2xx status code as the message was delivered successfully
- While the Standard Webhooks Spec suggests a schedule for resends, FreeStuff may use a different timing for when resends are scheduled
- If you fail to receive multiple events in a row (no 2xx codes returned in multiple consecutive events spanning multiple days) your webhook will be considered dead and will be removed from our system. This will not revoke your api access entirely but you will have to configure your webhook again.


## Responding to webhook requests

- A code of `204 No Content` with an empty body is prefered as the server will ignore your response body anyway
- If for any reason you cannot send a `204`, any other `2xx` code is accepted as well
- You may send a `X-Set-Compatibility-Date` header with a compatibility date on your response
  - If the value is a valid compatibility date the setting in your app will be overwritten to use this compatibility date for all subsequent deliveries
  - The new compatibility date already applies to resends so you can respond with a `4xx` code if you read an unexpected `X-Compatibility-Date` request header and force FreeStuff to deliver the message again with the correct date
  - Library authors are encouraged to set this header on every response to the newest compatibility date their library is compatible with, as well as to `4xx` every request with an incompatible `X-Compatibility-Date` request header. This way users can easily install and update your library without manual configuration on the dashboard or even knowing about the compatibility date system
  - If you respond with a non `2xx` status while having an invalid value for your `X-Set-Compatibility-Date`, the message will not be scheduled for a resend as it is assumed you let the request fail because of the compatibility date missmatch while expecting a non-valid date
- You may send a `X-Client-Library` header with details about your library
  - Library authors are encouraged to set this header on every response
  - The format should be `Library Name/version (url to library homepage or git repo)` - e.g. `FreeStuff.py/1.0.2 (https://github.com/my/fake-repo)`


## Event List

### urn:fsb:event:ping

Fired either when the ping button was pressed on your dashboard or periodically to check if your webhook is still operational.

The `data` field will contain the following object:

```jsonc
{
  "manual": boolean // will be true if you manually requested this ping, false otherwise
}
```


### urn:fsb:event:product.published

Fired when a new product is published.

The `data` field will contain a single `Product`.

:data-model{name="Product"}


### urn:fsb:event:product.updated

Fired when an existing product is updated.

The `data` field will contain the **full** `Product` data, not just the changes.
