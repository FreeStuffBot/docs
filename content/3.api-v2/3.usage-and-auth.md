# Usage & Auth

## Base Url

All endpoints are available on `https://api.freestuffbot.xyz/v2`


## Auth

You should already have an API key. If not please check out the [Getting Started](/introduction/getting-started) page.

Your API key should be present in the `Authorization` header on every request to the API. Prefix your API key with the word `Basic` as your access is of type basic.

So assuming your API key is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", this is how your header should look like:
`Authorization: Basic ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`
